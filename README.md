# Blockchain Based Supply Chain Management

<b><p align="justify">Abstract: In today’s globalized marketplace, efficient and transparent supply chain management is paramount. This project harnesses cutting-edge technology stacks to develop a robust and forward-thinking solution. At its core, it leverages the Ethereum blockchain platform, utilizing Solidity smart contracts to ensure the tamper-proof tracking of goods from their origin to their ultimate destination. This blockchain-based foundation establishes an unassailable record of all supply chain transaction, enhancing transparency, traceability, and trust. The project incorporates Ganache, a personal blockchain for Ethereum development, enabling seamless testing and deployment of smart contracts within a local, simulated environment. The frontend, designed with React JS, offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for supply chain stakeholders. It enables real-time tracking, ensuring that users can access and validate crucial product and transaction data at any point in the supply chain process. Additionally, a comprehensive tracker has been integrated, allowing stakeholders to monitor the journey of any product along the supply chain flow, providing visibility into the parties involved at each stage. User authentication is provided by Ethereum stakeholder addresses, leveraging the inherent security and decentralized nature of the Ethereum blockchain. Web3.js enables smooth communication between the blockchain network and the backend, facilitating the seamless exchange of data and information. On the backend, powered by Node.js, seamless data processing and management is facilitated. This rich technology stack creates a dependable, decentralized, and transparent supply chain management that enhances accountability and trust throughout the entire supply network. By fostering transparency and traceability, this project empowers business to operate more efficiently and confidently in today’s complex and interconnected global market.</div></b>
